# RandomNumbers_cleanSwift

 Create a single screen standalone app.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - There should be a List on the screen, progress indicator and "Add" button. How it should look - decide by yourself.
 - That List contains numbers, and it should be sorted from the highest value to lowest. Cells UI is on your choise.
 - By pressing "Add" button, there should be a random number generated (from 0 to 100 ) and added to the List. Delay when adding should be equal to 2 seconds. There should be a load indicator shown during delay.
 - "Swipe-to-delete" should be used to remove List items. There should be an "Undo" button somewhere on the screen. By pressing that button, last removed item should be brought back to the list. Delay when restoring should be equal to 2 seconds. There should be a load indicator shown during delay.
 - When adding new items, UI should not be blocked. There should be a support for multiple items adding\restoring in the same time.
